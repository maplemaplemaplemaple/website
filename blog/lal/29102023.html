     <h2> 29/10/2023 LANGUAGES!!111 - BEGINNINGS & STUFF</h2>
      <br>
 <p> languages. we speak them. once another interest of mine cause theyre fascinating and everything about them is really cool. so lets go in depth about them, shall we? lets begin.</p>
      <br>
      <p> the most interesting languages to me are arabic and japanese. arabic being one of the hardest languages requiring years of practice, and japanese being hard to learn but still require about-</p>
      <p> years to completely being nearly fluent or fluent in it. although if you did arabic everyday and nearly nothing else you would probably get fluent way faster, it is much harder for learners-</p>
      <p> that cannot complete that type of task. me still being in school and much of a dummy was left with a choice - which one would i choose? i had a few other choices handpicked and thrown into the-</p>
      <p> wheel of "which one should i choose?" i had spanish, which i had prior experience of learning in, arabic which is one of the hardest languages, and japanese. after a bit it landed on spanish. </p>
      <br>
<p> in my opinion, spanish is a pretty easy language to learn which was good for me, and it is by far one of the most worldwide learned languages, other than most likely english.</p>
      <p> thats kind of it for now, ill continue on whenever i can about other stuff.</p>
