      <br>
<p> this post is gonna be a short one, but recently i remembered that i could possibly go to an enrichment class. this is good news for me cause my school most likely has computer science classes-</p>
      <p> and i confirmed that there are classes for languages like french and spanish. i would have to consider what language i'd like to learn though, so thats that.</p>
