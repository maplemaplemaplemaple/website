     <h2> 29/10/2023 MUSIC!!111 - BEGINNINGS & GENRES</h2>
      <br>
      <p> music is another one of my passion and ill be posting it here ig</p>
      <p> the genres i've always liked is classical music. for example, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBsKplb2E6Q">dance of the knights by Prokofiev.</a></p>
      <p> dance of the knights is a pretty popular piece in the genre of classical music, and many other pieces by Prokofiev are too. theyre pretty good and have undeserved fame</p>
      <p> the instruments in harmony, the transistions everything makes it perfect.</p>
      <br>
      <p> speaking of instruments, i play 2 instruments. the french horn and clarinet. generally, i would not recommend you play french horn FIRST. start off with another brass instrument like-</p>
      <p> trumpet. it can get you used to the basics and then french horn would be a bit easier to you. clarinet you can just go with right ahead, its a decently easy instrument. although it is a-</p>
      <p> beautiful instrument it is really easy to play, but it gets harder as time goes on. and its kinda like that with every instrument.</p>
      <br>
      <p> i have taken interest to making my own stuff in FL studio, still working on it right now. i also took a interest to composing music on my own in things like musescore and noteflight-</p>
      <p> which is slightly easier to do instead of actually playing and writing it down lol ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ </p>
      <br>
<p> i will be uploading other music i found that hasn't been uploaded yet here onto a different part of this music blog so yeah.</p>
