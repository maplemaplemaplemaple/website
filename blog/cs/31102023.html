<h2> DISECTING EARLY 2000'S WEBSITES</h2>
  <p> early 2000's website didnt really rely on the functions i showed in the last post, but rather on the style design which made it look so nostalgic. </p>
      <p> for example, look at myspace's design. you'll see the code looks real modern, but the style and design is seemingly old. </p>
      <p> what i observed is quite interesting, and honestly showed how different design and coding was from now. it was quite easy to replicate, and fun to do.</p>
      <p> i did look at a other website with much cleaner and understandable code, and it gave me a bit clearer view.</p>
      <p> by tommorow i will most likely replicate the design and make a page that should have proper 2000's design. </p>
      <br>
      <p> see you tommorow ðŸ¥½ </p>
