<p> hi. on the last page by "see you tommorow" i did not mean 5/6 days but here we are.</p>
      <br>
<p> what i saw was the usage of gradients in CSS which is unique and hard, but still doable. i could retry this with images but I decided to go with CSS. </p>
      <p> i still havent done it yet so tommorow or at some point i will go to stackoverflow (the best outlet for coders like ever) to see if it can help me.</p>
      <p> this is a decently easy task now that i look at it though. speaking of 2000s' design, i made a website like that a month ago for a ARG i was in.</p>
      <p> i do have alot of old 2000's gifs saved from it which I can put up to use, which is very helpful.</p>
      <br>
      <p> i guess ill see you guys when i get it finished.</p>
