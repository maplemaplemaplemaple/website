      <p> the corpse of a flower, also known as flowerment is a project that i made but still a multi-person project. it is a spinoff of the foenems-</p>
      <br>
      <p> with some foenems even participating in it! it is about people who worship flowers and use them as energizers.</p>
      <br>
      <p> fun fact: i created the corpse of a flower! </p>
